#ARMonkeyKit

This repository was moved to Github from an old [Google Code repository](http://code.google.com/p/armonkeykit). It uses the now superceded jMonkeyEngine2. Any future development will be conducted on this repository and **not** Google Code.

## What Is ARMonkeyKit?

ARMonkeyKit is a framework which draws on the power of NyARToolKit and jMonkeyEngine to enable fast prototyping of Augmented Reality applications in the JAVA programming language. The framework aims to provide a single point of entry into the underlying technologies, greatly reducing the amount of code which is required from the developer.

A number of examples are provided in the source code, with commenting to show how to create your own Augmented Reality application using the framework, a more comprehensive guide will appear here in the future.

A development blog covering advances and examples of the use of this framework can be found at [http://armonkeykit.wordpress.com](http://armonkeykit.wordpress.com)

You can see a short video showing the frame rates which we can obtain using the framework on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkMHNwBmApE).
